react + mobx project that uses streaks to deter relapsing into bad habits, meant to be used from phones mainly. This was an idea I always had and I wanted to bring it to fruition with the added benefit of having

## concept
All habits have a trigger to them. When trying to quit an existing habit, a good strategy is to identify the triggers to the existing habit and replace it with a different action.

This action has to be something must be easy enough to replace the habitual action and it has to be consistently stuck to. 

The idea behind the app is to create cards for whatever habit you are trying to quit, e.g. avoided smoking a cigarette, then replace the habitual action with tapping the card whenever you encounter a trigger. This is designed to be very simple and easy to do to deter the user from not wanting to do the replacement action by justifying it as difficult to do.

The increasing counter both provides feedback for the new action at every trigger and acts as a deterrent from relapsing as the number grows larger. Since it will be easier to avoid the habitual action at first, a streak is built up. The idea is for the streak to act as a psychological barrier against relapsing by substituting it with the desire to not break the streak.
